Coffee is an important commodity in the world economy. But unfortunately, productivity and quality of those commodities results are still quite low. This is caused by the disease in coffee plants. 

The research objective is to create an application that can help researchers or observers working in coffee plantation to diagnose diseases of coffee plants. 

The method used is fuzzy logic-based expert systems, and decision tree using a hierarchical classification. Knowledge about coffee, its symptoms, and its disease is extracted from human expert and then is converted into a decision tree. It will result on the fuzzy logic-based expert systems. 

From the experiments, accuracy calculation of the system is about 85%. Based on the accuracy, it can be concluded that this application can be a bit much to help researchers or observers of the coffee plants in diagnosing coffee plants diseases earlier.
